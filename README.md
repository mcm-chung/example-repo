# example-repo
This is just an example of doing a repo and using git with it.

NEVER CLONE A REPO INTO A REPO

-git clone repo URL

-modify/edit file -> make sure to SAVE

-git add -A -> added the change files to the staging area

-git command -m "meaningful message about commit" -> update our local with the changes

-git push origin main -> 
-origin ->remote -> github
-main -> current branch we are working on

-git status -> check staging and commited
